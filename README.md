# Phishingwebsite
I have chosen to use a supervised machine learning approach to build a model that predicts whether a website is a Phishing website for several reasons. Firstly, I believe that this approach is the most appropriate for this task as it involves using labeled data to train a model to make predictions on new data. This is ideal for a classification problem such as this one, where the goal is to identify whether a website is a Phishing website or not.
I have chosen to use the Python language and the sci-kit-learn library for implementing the machine learning model. I believe that these tools are well-suited for this task as they provide a wide range of tools and techniques for building machine learning models, including various classification algorithms. I have done all coding in jupyter notebook environment.
I have tried various ML algorithms to predict. For this specific task, I have chosen to use a random forest classifier. Random forest are a simple and interpretable type of algorithm that can handle both categorical and numerical data, which is well-suited for this dataset. This makes it an ideal choice for this task as the data provided contains a variety of categorical and numerical variables, and the Random Forest can handle all of them.
RandomForestClassifier 97.76%
Overall, I believe that this approach, along with the specific tools and techniques that I have chosen, will provide a robust and accurate model for predicting whether a website is a Phishing website.
